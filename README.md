## Get started

To generate entity labels (IO scheme), you need to install *fuzzywuzzy* lib.

```
pip install fuzzywuzzy
```

and then run

```
cd reverse_linking
python reverse_linking.py
```

and *train.txt/valid.txt/test.txt* will be generated in *V1* fold and you are ready to go.
